Object Oriented PIXI in Javascript

This is an experiment to build an OOP game in PIXIJS using Javascript classes and native ES6 modules. There is no publish folder or compilation process ðŸ¤¯. The game is deployed [here](https://snake-game-one-tau.vercel.app/) or just open index.html via a live server or localhost!
